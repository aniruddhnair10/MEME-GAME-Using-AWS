MEME GAME Using AWS 


Continuous Deployment using AWS Code Pipeline and S3

In this we create an S3 bucket for static website hosting, then create a continuous deployment pipeline (using AWS Code Pipeline) to automatically deploy the code whenever changes are made.


The Game


A simple memory matching game. The user clicks two cards (images of memes) to try to match them. If there's a match, the cards disappear from the board. If there's no match, the cards are flipped back to their blank side so the user can try again.


The game consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


Ideas for additional features:


A scoring mechanism


A timer


Add additional cards


Multi-player capabilities so you can compare scores
